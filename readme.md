Xocial Core jQuery Plugin
===================================================

Xocial Core was created to help assist in connecting with Facebook and integrating other social services into websites and Facebook applications.

Several of the functions have been heavily "inspired" by other projects from around the web and I'll try and make sure to keep the list of those projects below for anyone interested in the original projects.

Most of these projects have focused on fixed implementations, Xocial Core is geared more around assisting in the retrieval of the external data and the implementation is largely left to the developer.

xocialCore includes the fantastic jQuery plugin blockUI from http://jquery.malsup.com/block/
